Type Keywords:

class - A user defined blueprint where objects are created. A function that combines methods, fields, properties and events into a single unit. 

struct - A structure that encapsulates small data values and groups of related variables.
E.g: constructors, constants, fields, methods, properties, indexers, operators, events and nested types.

------------------------------------------
Access Modifier's:
Define the accessibility of the class and it's memebers. 

public - Allows any part of the program in the assembly to access the type and its members. 

private - Restricts other parts of the program from accessing the type and it's members. Only code in the smae class or struct can access it. 

internal - Allows other program code in the same assembly to access the type or it's members. 

protected - Allows codes in the same class or a class that derives from that class to access the type or it's members.  

------------------------------------------
Modifier's:

override - Used to replace a virtual and abstract members that is defined in a base class with the definition of that member in the derived class. 

abstract - Indicates that the thing being modified has a missing or incomplete implementation. 
Use in a class declaration to indicate that a class is intended only to be a base class of other classes, not instantiated on it's own. 
(Implementation isn't needed).

readonly - Defines a read only field in our application.

----------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------
General Definition's:

interface - Similar to a class but purely represents a contract between an object and it's user.

Dictionary<TKey, TValue> - Links a particular key with a value.

Fields - A variable of any type that is declared directly in a class or struct. Fields are members of their containing type.

Constuctor - A method of the class which gets invoked whenever an instance of the class is created.
