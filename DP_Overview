Creational Patterns:

Abstract Factory - Creates an instance of several families of classes. 

Builder - Seperates object construction from its representation. 

Factory Method - Creates an instance of severa; derived classes.

Prototype - A fully initialized instance to be copied or cloned. 

Singleton Pattern - A class of which only a single instance can exist. 


Structural Patterns:

Adapter - Match interfaces of different classes. 

Bridge - Seperates an object's interface from its implemention. 

Composite - A tree structure of simple and composite objects. 

Decorator - Add responsibilities to objects dynamically.
